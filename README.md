### Hello! üòÅ

My name is Juan Junger, from Brazil. 

Undergraduating in analysis and systems development, I have been part of project design, requirements gathering, documentation, architecture and development, testing and maintenance.

Passionate about technology, I work as fullstack developer and have experience in game design.

Always committed to seeking and acquiring new knowledge, I develop my skills in each new situation and, with that, I improve myself more and more.

Currently focused on studies in React and Node developing practical projects.

Would you like to contact me?
